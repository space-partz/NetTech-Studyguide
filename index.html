                        <p>This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of database systems, explaining why databases are essential, the difference between data and information, and the importance of proper database design.</p>
                    </div>

                    <section id="topic-1-1" class="topic">
                        <h3>1-1 Why Databases?</h3>
                        <div class="topic-content">
                            <p>In today's world, data is ubiquitous (abundant, global, everywhere) and pervasive (unescapable, prevalent, persistent). From birth to death, we generate and consume data. The trail of data starts with the birth certificate and continues all the way to a death certificate (and beyond!). In between, each individual produces and consumes enormous amounts of data. As you will see in this book, databases are the best way to store and manage data. Databases make data persistent and shareable in a secure way.</p>
                            
                            <p>Data is not only ubiquitous and pervasive; it is also essential for organizations to survive and prosper. Imagine trying to operate a business without knowing who your customers are, what products you are selling, who is working for you, who owes you money, and to whom you owe money. All businesses have to keep this type of data and much more. Just as important, they must have that data available to decision makers when necessary. It can be argued that the ultimate purpose of all business information systems is to help businesses use information as an organizational resource. At the heart of all of these systems are the collection, storage, aggregation, manipulation, dissemination, and management of data.</p>
                            
                            <p>Depending on the type of information system and the characteristics of the business, this data could vary from a few megabytes on just one or two topics to petabytes covering hundreds of topics within the business's internal and external environment. Telecommunications companies, such as Sprint and AT&T, are known to have systems that keep data on trillions of phone calls, with new data being added to the system at speeds up to 70,000 calls per second! Not only do these companies have to store and manage immense collections of data, but they must be able to find any given fact in that data quickly. Consider the case of Internet search staple Google. While Google is reluctant to disclose many details about its data storage specifications, it is estimated that the company responds to over 91 million searches per day across a collection of data that is several terabytes in size. Impressively, the results of these searches are available almost instantly.</p>
                            
                            <p>How can these businesses process this much data? How can they store it all, and then quickly retrieve just the facts that decision makers want to know, just when they want to know it? The answer is that they use databases. Databases, as explained in detail throughout this book, are specialized structures that allow computer-based systems to store, manage, and retrieve data very quickly. Virtually all modern business systems rely on databases. Therefore, a good understanding of how these structures are created and their proper use is vital for any information systems professional. Even if your career does not take you down the amazing path of database design and development, databases will be a key component of the systems that you use. In any case, you will probably make decisions in your career based on information generated from data. Thus, it is important that you know the difference between data and information.</p>

                        <h3>1-2 Data versus Information</h3>
                        <div class="topic-content">
                            <p>To understand what drives database design, you must understand the difference between data and information. Data consists of raw facts. The word raw indicates that the facts have not yet been processed to reveal their meaning.</p>
                            
                            <div class="definition-box">
                                <h4>Data</h4>
                                <p>Raw facts that have not yet been processed to reveal their meaning.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <div class="definition-box">
                                <h4>Information</h4>
                                <p>The result of processing raw data to reveal its meaning. Data processing can be as simple as organizing data to reveal patterns or as complex as making forecasts or drawing inferences using statistical modeling.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Information requires context to reveal meaning. For example, an average temperature reading of 105 degrees does not mean much unless you also know its context: Is this reading in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius? Is this a machine temperature, a body temperature, or an outside air temperature? Information can be used as the foundation for decision making.</p>
                            
                            <p>Keep in mind that raw data must be properly formatted for storage, processing, and presentation. For example, dates might be stored in Julian calendar formats within the database, but displayed in a variety of formats, such as day-month-year or month/day/year, for different purposes.</p>

                                <h4>Example: Smartphone Location Data</h4>
                                <p>In today's information-centric society, you use smartphones on a daily basis. These devices have advanced GPS functionality that constantly tracks your whereabouts. This data is stored and shared with various applications.</p>
                                <p>When you get a new smartphone, you can use the map application to go places and to set up your home address. The GPS feature in your phone tracks your daily locations. In some cases, the information generated is very helpful: it can help you navigate to various locations and even to find where you parked your car.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, your smartphone may know more about your activities than you imagine. For example, suppose that every Wednesday night you go to the gym and play indoor soccer with your friends. Next Wednesday night, 20 minutes before you leave home, your phone pops up a message saying "19 minutes to [gym address]. Traffic is light." The phone has been storing GPS data on your movements to develop patterns based on days, times, and locations to generate this knowledge.</p>

                            <p>Efficient data management typically requires the use of a computer database.</p>

                                <h4>Database</h4>
                                <p>A shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>End-user data—that is, raw facts of interest to the end user</li>

                            <p>The metadata describes the data characteristics and the set of relationships that links the data found within the database. For example, the metadata component stores information such as the name of each data element, the type of values (numeric, dates, or text) stored on each data element, and whether the data element can be left empty. The metadata provides information that complements and expands the value and use of the data. In short, metadata presents a more complete picture of the data in the database. Given the characteristics of metadata, you might hear a database described as a "collection of self-describing data."</p>

                                <p>A collection of programs that manages the database structure and controls access to the data stored in the database. In a sense, a database resembles a very well-organized electronic filing cabinet in which powerful software (the DBMS) helps manage the cabinet's contents.</p>

                            <p>The DBMS serves as the intermediary between the user and the database. The database structure itself is stored as a collection of files, and the only way to access the data in those files is through the DBMS.</p>
                            
                            <p>Having a DBMS between the end user's applications and the database offers some important advantages:</p>

                        <h3>1-4 Why Database Design Is Important</h3>
                        <div class="topic-content">
                            <p>Database design refers to the activities that focus on the design of the database structure that will be used to store and manage end-user data. A database that meets all user requirements does not just happen; its structure must be designed carefully. In fact, database design is such a crucial aspect of working with databases that most of this book is dedicated to the development of good database design techniques. Even a good DBMS will perform poorly with a badly designed database.</p>
                            
                            <p>Data is one of an organization's most valuable assets. Data on customers, employees, orders, and receipts is all vital to the existence of a company. Tracking key growth and performance indicators are also vital to strategic and tactical plans to ensure future success; therefore, an organization's data must not be handled lightly or carelessly.</p>
                            
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <h4>Example: Poor Database Design</h4>
                                <p>Consider the data which illustrates the efforts of an organization to keep records about its employees and their skills. Some employees have not passed a certification test in any skill, while others have been certified in several skills. Some certified skills are shared by several employees, while other skills have no employees that hold those certifications.</p>
                                
                                <p>Based on a poor storage design, the following problems might occur:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It would be difficult to produce an alphabetical listing of employees based on their last names.</li>
                                    <li>To determine how many employees are certified in a specific skill would require complex counting across multiple columns.</li>
                                    <li>Redundant storage of skill names could lead to inconsistencies in spelling or abbreviation.</li>
                                    <li>The structure would need to be changed if an employee gets certified in additional skills.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>A better design would decompose the data into related tables that contain all the same data but structured in a way that allows easy manipulation and querying.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Proper database design requires the designer to precisely identify the database's expected use. Designing a transactional database emphasizes accurate and consistent data and operational speed. Designing a data warehouse database emphasizes the use of historical and aggregated data.</p>
                            
                            <p>A well-designed database facilitates data management and generates accurate and valuable information. A poorly designed database is likely to become a breeding ground for difficult-to-trace errors that may lead to poor decision making, and poor decision making can lead to the failure of an organization. Database design is simply too important to be left to luck.</p>

                        <div class="topic-content">
                            <p>Understanding what a database is, what it does, and the proper way to use it can be clarified by considering what a database is not. A brief explanation of the evolution of file system data processing can be helpful in understanding the data access limitations that databases attempt to overcome.</p>

                            <h4>1-5a Manual File Systems</h4>
                            <p>Historically, data was kept in paper-and-pencil manual systems organized to facilitate the expected use of the data. Typically, this was accomplished through a system of file folders and filing cabinets.</p>

                            <h4>1-5b Computerized File Systems</h4>
                            <p>Generating reports from manual file systems was slow and cumbersome. Therefore, a data processing (DP) specialist was hired to create a computer-based system that would track data and produce required reports.</p>

                        <div class="topic-content">
                            <p>The file system method of organizing and managing data was a definite improvement over the manual system, and the file system served a useful purpose in data management for over two decades. Nonetheless, many problems and limitations became evident in this approach.</p>

                            <div class="key-points">
                                <h4>Major Problems with File Systems:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Lengthy development times:</strong> Even the simplest data-retrieval task requires extensive programming.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Difficulty of getting quick answers:</strong> Ad hoc queries are impossible.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Complex system administration:</strong> System administration becomes more difficult as the number of files expands.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lack of security and limited data sharing:</strong> Security features are often inadequate.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Extensive programming:</strong> Making changes to existing file structures is difficult.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>A file system exhibits structural dependence, which means that access to a file is dependent on its structure. For example, adding a customer date-of-birth field to the CUSTOMER file would require significant program modifications.</p>

                            <div class="definition-box">
                                <h4>Data Dependence</h4>
                                <p>Exists when all data access programs are subject to change when any of the file's data storage characteristics change.</p>

                            <p>The file system's structure makes it difficult to combine data from multiple sources, and its lack of security renders the file system vulnerable to security breaches. The organizational structure promotes the storage of the same basic data in different locations.</p>

                                <li><strong>Update anomalies:</strong> Changes must be made to the same data in multiple places</li>
                                <li><strong>Insertion anomalies:</strong> New data requires dummy entries in related files</li>
                                <li><strong>Deletion anomalies:</strong> Deleting data can unintentionally remove other needed data</li>

                            <p>Database design focuses on how the database structure will be used to store and manage end-user data. Data modeling, the first step in designing a database, refers to the process of creating a specific data model for a determined problem domain.</p>

                                <p>The terms data model and database model are often used interchangeably. In this book, the term database model is used to refer to the implementation of a data model in a specific database system.</p>

                            <p>Data modeling is an iterative, progressive process. You start with a simple understanding of the problem domain, and as your understanding increases, so does the level of detail of the data model.</p>

                            <p>In Chapter 1, you learned that a database stores and manages both data and metadata. The relational data model changed database design by allowing designers to focus on the logical representation of the data and its relationships, rather than on the physical storage details.</p>

                                <h4>Analogy</h4>
                                <p>The relational database uses an automatic transmission to relieve you of the need to manipulate clutch pedals and gearshifts. In short, the relational model enables you to view data logically rather than physically.</p>

                            <p>The logical view of the relational database is facilitated by the creation of data relationships based on a logical construct known as a relation. Because a relation is a mathematical construct, end users find it much easier to think of a relation as a table.</p>

                            <p>In Chapter 1, you learned that data redundancy leads to data anomalies, which can destroy the effectiveness of the database. The proper use of foreign keys is crucial to controlling data redundancy, although they do not totally eliminate the problem.</p>

                                <h4>Test of Redundancy</h4>
                                <p>The real test of redundancy is not how many copies of a given attribute are stored, but whether the elimination of an attribute will eliminate information. If you delete an attribute and the original information can still be generated through relational algebra, the inclusion of that attribute would be redundant.</p>

                            <p>Because an entity represents a real-world object, the words entity and object are often used interchangeably. Thus, the entities (objects) of the Tiny College database design developed in this chapter include students, classes, teachers, and classrooms.</p>

                            <p>In Chapter 2, you also learned about the various notations used with ERDs—the original Chen notation and the newer Crow's Foot and UML notations. The first two notations are used at the beginning of this chapter to introduce some basic ER modeling concepts. Some conceptual database modeling concepts can be expressed only using the Chen notation.</p>

                            <p>An entity is an object of interest to the end user. At the ER modeling level, an entity actually refers to the entity set and not to a single entity occurrence. In other words, an entity in the ERM corresponds to a table—not to a row—in the relational environment.</p>
                            
                            <p>The ERM refers to a table row as an entity instance or entity occurrence. In the Chen, Crow's Foot, and UML notations, an entity is represented by a rectangle that contains the entity's name. The entity name, a noun, is usually written in all capital letters.</p>

                        <h3 id="section-4-3">4-3 Attributes</h3>
                        <div class="topic-content">
                            <p>Attributes are characteristics of entities. For example, the STUDENT entity includes the attributes STU_LNAME, STU_FNAME, and STU_INITIAL, among many others. In the original Chen notation, attributes are represented by ovals and are connected to the entity rectangle with a line.</p>

                            <h4>Required and Optional Attributes</h4>
                            <p>A required attribute is an attribute that must have a value; in other words, it cannot be left empty. As shown in Figure 4.1, the two boldfaced attributes in the Crow's Foot notation indicate that data entry will be required. STU_LNAME and STU_FNAME require data entries because all students are assumed to have a last name and a first name.</p>

                            <h4>Domains</h4>
                            <p>Attributes have a domain. A domain is the set of possible values for a given attribute. For example, the domain for a grade point average (GPA) attribute is written (0,4) because the lowest possible GPA value is 0 and the highest possible value is 4.</p>

                            <h4>Identifiers (Primary Keys)</h4>
                            <p>The ERM uses identifiers—one or more attributes that uniquely identify each entity instance. In the relational model, entities are mapped to tables, and the entity identifier is mapped as the table's primary key (PK).</p>

                            <h4>Composite Identifiers</h4>
                            <p>Ideally, an entity identifier is composed of only a single attribute. For example, the table in Figure 4.2 uses a single-attribute primary key named CLASS_CODE. However, it is possible to use a composite identifier, a primary key composed of more than one attribute.</p>

                            <div class="note-box">
                                <h4>Course vs. Class Distinction</h4>
                                <p>Remember that Chapter 3 made a commonly accepted distinction between COURSE and CLASS. A CLASS constitutes a specific time and place of a COURSE offering. A class is defined by the course description and its time and place, or section.</p>
                                <p>Consider a professor who teaches Database I, Section 2; Database I, Section 5; Database I, Section 8; and Spreadsheet II, Section 6. The professor teaches two courses (Database I and Spreadsheet II), but four classes. Typically, the COURSE offerings are printed in a course catalog, while the CLASS offerings are printed in a class schedule for each term.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Composite and Simple Attributes</h4>
                            <p>Attributes are classified as simple or composite. A composite attribute is an attribute that can be further subdivided to yield additional attributes. For example, the attribute ADDRESS can be subdivided into street, city, state, and zip code.</p>
                            
                            <p>A simple attribute is an attribute that cannot be subdivided. For example, age, sex, and marital status would be classified as simple attributes. To facilitate detailed queries, it is wise to change composite attributes into a series of simple attributes.</p>

                            <h4>Single-Valued Attributes</h4>
                            <p>A single-valued attribute is an attribute that can have only a single value. For example, a person can have only one Social Security number, and a manufactured part can have only one serial number.</p>

                            <h4>Multivalued Attributes</h4>
                            <p>Multivalued attributes are attributes that can have many values. For instance, a person may have several college degrees, and a household may have several different phones, each with its own number. Similarly, a car's color may be subdivided into many colors for the roof, body, and trim.</p>

                            <div class="note-box">
                                <p>In the ERD models in Figure 4.3, the CAR entity's foreign key (FK) has been typed as MOD_CODE. This attribute was manually added to the entity. Actually, proper use of database modeling software will automatically produce the FK when the relationship is defined.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Derived Attributes</h4>
                            <p>A derived attribute is an attribute whose value is calculated (derived) from other attributes. The derived attribute need not be physically stored within the database; instead, it can be derived by using an algorithm.</p>

                                <h4>Example: Derived Attributes</h4>

                                    <li>Estimated average speed can be derived by dividing trip distance by time</li>

                        <div class="topic-content">
                            <p>Recall from Chapter 2 that a relationship is an association between entities. The entities that participate in a relationship are also known as participants, and each relationship is identified by a name that describes the relationship.</p>

                            <p>The relationship name is an active or passive verb; for example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A STUDENT takes a CLASS</li>
                                <li>A PROFESSOR teaches a CLASS</li>
                                <li>A DEPARTMENT employs a PROFESSOR</li>
                                <li>A DIVISION is managed by an EMPLOYEE</li>
                                <li>An AIRCRAFT is flown by a CREW</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Relationships between entities always operate in both directions. To define the relationship between the entities named CUSTOMER and INVOICE, you would specify that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A CUSTOMER may generate many INVOICEs.</li>
                                <li>Each INVOICE is generated by one CUSTOMER.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Connectivity and Cardinality</h4>
                            <p>The term connectivity is used to describe the relationship classification. Cardinality expresses the minimum and maximum number of entity occurrences associated with one occurrence of the related entity.</p>

                            <div class="key-points">
                                <h4>Important Concepts:</h4>

                                    <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Describes relationship types (1:1, 1:M, or M:N)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cardinality:</strong> Expresses specific minimum and maximum numbers of related entities</li>
                                    <li><strong>Format:</strong> Cardinality is indicated using (x,y) where x is minimum and y is maximum</li>

                                    <li>A team must have a minimum of 5 players</li>
                                    <li>A team can have a maximum of 8 players</li>
                                    <li>A player can be assigned to only one team</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This would be expressed as cardinality (5,8) from Player to Team, and (1,1) from Team to Player.</p>

                                <p>Many database designers using Crow's Foot notation do not depict specific cardinalities on the ER diagram because these specific limits cannot be implemented directly through database design.

                            <p>The concept of relationship strength is based on how the primary key of a related entity is defined. To implement a relationship, the primary key of one entity appears as a foreign key in the related entity.</p>

                            <h4>Weak (Non-Identifying) Relationships</h4>
                            <p>A weak relationship, also known as a non-identifying relationship, exists if the primary key of the related entity does not contain a primary key component of the parent entity. By default, relationships are established by having the primary key of the parent entity appear as a foreign key (FK) on the related entity.</p>

                            <h4>Strong (Identifying) Relationships</h4>
                            <p>A strong (identifying) relationship exists when the primary key of the related entity contains a primary key component of the parent entity. For example, if the CLASS entity primary key is composed of CRS_CODE and CLASS_SECTION, where CRS_CODE is inherited from the COURSE entity.</p>

                            <p>As the complexity of data structures being modeled has increased and application software requirements have become more stringent, the need to capture more information in the data model has increased. The extended entity relationship model (EERM), sometimes referred to as the enhanced entity relationship model, is the result of adding more semantic constructs to the original ER model. A diagram that uses the EERM is called an EER diagram (EERD).</p>

                            <p>Data modelers must find various ways to group entities based on their characteristics. For instance, a retail company could group employees as salaried and hourly, while a university could group employees as faculty, staff, and administrators.</p>
